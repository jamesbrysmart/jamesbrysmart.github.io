          <h2> Time and habits</h2>
          <p> 
            Improving my time management has long been a goal of mine, so two extensions that I have installed through this course will be interesting to see how much they help.
            Toggl and Strict Workflow are both potentially very useful, as Toggl actively monitors the time I spend on a project, which sub-consciously makes me less likely to procrastinate while it's running (and annoying to stop and start constantly). 
            Strict Workflow (using the Pomodoro method) uses the same kind of thinking, allocating specific 25 minute periods to certain tasks, and also actively blocks tempting website that could be a distraction while the extension is running. Excited to see if they make a difference!
          </p>
          <p>
            Poor time management is often due to lack of discipline (in my case) and not appreciating how long tasks take. It's rarely due to feeling overly stressed, so meditation has in the past not had much value. 
            Starting small is great advice and key to not feeling overwhelmed by a project before you get started, and is also something I will continue to try and use in my life.
            Habit forming behaviour and a growth mindset are strands of the same way of thinking that I've recently tried to follow, which is that practice is everything. Everytime you pick up the guitar, go for a run, start coding, you are improving. That alone usually is enough motivation for me to do that thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, my personal struggle is more often with allowing the day to slip by due to poor time management, multi tasking and getting distracted rather than dedicating specific time to a specific task than lack of motivation. Hopefully the tools I've downloaded will help me manage that better.
