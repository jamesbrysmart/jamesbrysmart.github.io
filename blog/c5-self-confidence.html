        <h2> Self-confidence</h2>
        <p> 
          There is a very close relationship between self-awareness and mindfulness. Self-awareness is a deeper understanding of ourselves, specifically
          around understanding our own emotional responses, understanding our strengths and weaknesses and maintaining a core sense of self-confidence.
          Mindfulness is maintaining a presence of mind, regardless of the circumstances - not getting overwhelmed by the emotions of a moment. Both require
          an element of mental self-discipline and understanding of how our mind works, and ability to control it rather than letting it control us.      
        </p>
        <p>
           I found the body scan interesting - again, it was a challenge to not let my mind wander but the focus that came from it was quite
           peaceful and uncluttered. I've wanted to try journalling for a while, and will give it a try in NZ.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always had a pretty good handle on my emotions. Don't tend to lose my temper, or get upset. Being able to observe your 
          emotions and understand them is a definite advantage - an area I'd like to improve on (and will try in this course) is to
          not let negative emotions when I'm struggling cloud my mind - become self defeating. I will look to use methods in this book to help.
