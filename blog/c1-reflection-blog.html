          <h2> Reflection</h2>
          <p> 
            The main impression I get from the video, such as in the analogy of 'restaurant' vs 'kitchen', is that you get out what you put in.
            This is something that excites me as I'm in a very different mental space to when I went to university, when my main purpose was to pass the exams, 
            not to learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also a focus on collaboration and teamwork, which is great as it can be a very solitary experience learning such a technical subject, and helping others and getting helped by others would be crucial to success. 
            The emphasis on such intense hard work is obviously daunting, but at the same time exciting. 
            My biggest concern is that I won't learn enough to make this worthwhile, so I'm determined to throw myself in and make the most of the experience, and work harder than I have in a long time.
