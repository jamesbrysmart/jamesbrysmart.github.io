        <h2> Problem solving</h2>
        <p>
          It's extremely easy to blocked on a simple problem when coding - a missing semi-colon is the frequent offender for me. Practice
          makes perfect - happens less these days. I've had frequent blocks - the worst are ones when you have no idea where to start.
          The best way to handle it is to talk it through (Pseudocode), and watch your code make changes live, as well as consulting previous lessons. Always check first that it's not 
          just a stupid mistake, as those are the most frustrating especially when you waste time getting frustrated. The truth is I've not 
          had anything I can call an elegant solution yet - I'm hoping for more of those in the coming weeks!      
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeling when you put your code in and it works first time without needing any hints is borderline euphoria. On the other hand,
          going through your code for the 23rd time and still not seeing what you've done wrong is infuriating, and can definitely become counter productive.
          It's definitely best to take a breather and do something else, then come back with a clear head. If you understand the problem you're trying 
          to solve, but the code isn't quite right, that doesn't cause me as much stress as a total blank. Those are bad. I'm more than happy to ask for help
          rather than drive myself crazy, but what I try and do is delete it and start again (with the new knowledge in my head). A downside 
          of Codecademy style learning is you often just copy it down without learning it - need to do it fresh.

          The .map function allows us to create a new array from a previous one, by making a specific change to every element in that array.
          For example, an array could contain [1,2,3] and you could use a .map function to multiply every number by 2, leaving you with [2,4,6]
        </p>  
        <p>
          The filter method allows us to pick out elements from an array that meet a certain criteria - for example, words over a certain length- and 
          create a new array with those words. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The reduce method will turn the combined values of an array into a single number.
