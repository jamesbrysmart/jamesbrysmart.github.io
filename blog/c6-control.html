        <h2> Control</h2>
        <p> 
          When programming, the main emotions I feel when things don't work out as expected, is first off frustration and
          disappointment, followed by a wave of powerlessness when I can't work out what's gone wrong, then self-doubt and fear
          that I might not be up to the course.    
        </p>
        <p>
          The Siberian North Railroad exercise is a good way of pre-empting that rush of emotions, and regaining control so I can 
          process my thoughts clearly. A challenge though is that as time goes by, and you still can't find a solution, those emotions
          become harder to control, as they reflect a genuine possibility, of being unable to complete Phase 0. If you're stuck, you're stuck, and you need a feedback loop to learn.
          Thankfully there are people like Brian out there who will selflessly give their time to those of us with a less technical background. So in truth, the railroad is all well and good
          but really, you need a Brian.
