        <h2> Javascript language</h2>
        <p>
          Use cases for parentheses in Javascript are during the process of creating a function, when establishing which
          parameters need to be included to make the function run. For example if you were to create a function that would
          multiply two numbers by each other, x and y would be the parameters inside the brackets. The numbers would be assigned
          to the function when it is called. They are also used when surrounding conditional statements, and also used when establishing
          the order in which operations happen eg ((x+y) * n).       
        </p>
        <p>
           Square brackets are mostly used with objects or arrays. An array ( multiple pieces of data) would use square brackets to enclose it, signalling that it's an
           array. In order to access particular values in the array, you can use their index value, which would also be enclosed in square brackets. You can also use square
            bracket notation to access the property of an object, instead of dot notation.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Braces are used to define the start and end of a function (after the parameters) and also to split up
          different blocks of code within the function. They are also used when creating an object, before and after.     
        </p>  
        <p>
          Single and double quotes are both used in the creation of strings, when we want to input a word that doesn't yet have a pre-defined meaning 
          within Javascript.
