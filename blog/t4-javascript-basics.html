        <h2> Javascript Basics</h2>
        <h4> How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
        <p> 
           Javascript is the language that allows us to actually make things happen with our websites. Using the house analogy, with HTML and CSS,
           you could have a nicely structured, well designed house, but it requires Javascript to actually get the appliances/heating etc to work. 
           From a learning perspective, this was a significant step-up in difficulty. Whilst I could often understand the concept and the code when it was 
           written in front of me, when I had to think through a problem I almost always ended up using the hint. Very steep learning curve this one! More work 
           needed to feel comfortable. 
        </p>
          Control flow and loops are a way of explaining to the computer the exact specifications for which it should go about certain functions, more specifically
          in what order and until what condiition is met. For example, a comparison could be when we get up to go to work. First we wake up, then we check the time.
          If the time is still too early, we go back to sleep. This repeats until a condition is met (it's the right time), and we then get up. This if statement
          could be programmed using Javascript.  
        <p>
           The difference between arrays and objects is that an array is equivalent to a list, such as countries - 'New Zealand, Australia, UK' etc. An object 
           is something with a number of different properties, such as a country's population, language, flag etc. When accessing data from an array,
           we need to know where it lies in the list, and then call on it using the appropriate number. In this regard, the order of the array is very important.
           An object though, we just need to know the property name in order to access it either using dot or bracket notation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Functions are useful because they allow us to codify a particular process to be stored for future use. Once the code has been defined,
          we can continue to use this function time and again, which can be very useful if it is a common process, such as automatically  
          calculating the exchange rate every time we buy anything in a foreign currency.
