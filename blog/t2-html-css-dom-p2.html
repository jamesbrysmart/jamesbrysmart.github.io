        <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
        <p> 
          Grid based design allows for significant flexibility by splitting the interface down into columns or rows, which can be divided down into 12 columns.
          This enables the user to decide between the most common design styles, such as a row, 3 columns, 4 columns, or even 1 small column next to 1 much wider column.
          As 12 is divisible by 3, 4 and 2, this is all possible using the grid design. The flexibility this gives us as developers makes life much easier when structuring 
          a website to fit a design spec.

        <h4>  What's all the hype about responsive webpages? </h4>
        <p>
          As our use of the internet has moved further away from computer screens, and increasingly towards tablet and mobile screens, web pages need to be able to respond to 
          very different size screens and provide a similar user experience. Websites with strict margins are often incompatible with mobile screens, which is bad for the user 
          and will mean any mobile traffic will quickly leave the website. As such all websites need to be compatible with computer, tablet and mobile screens.  
        </p>        
        <h4> What is semantic structure? </h4>
        <p>
          Semantic structure helps us use CSS to break down the sections dependent on their intended purpose on the page. For example, H1 tells us that it is the most important
          part of the page, as well as how it should be formatted. H4 is still a header, but less important than H1 and this should be represented by how they look on the page.  
        </p> 
        <h4> Reflections? </h4>
        <p>
          Interested to see the clear difference between design and development. Development seems to be more about executing others designs, which is probably more up my street
          as I have no background in design. Some of the tasks thus far (building the blog etc) seem to have a focus on design as well, which is something I could also do with some help on the fundamentals.
