        <h2> Meditation process</h2>
        <p> 
          Process over product helped me focus on the most important aspect of what we are trying to achieve 
          - not a pretty blog - but a new skillset that Website will open doors to a new career and future. With that in mind, 
          wasting unnecessary time trying to perfect every aspect of the layout isn't a valuable use of time, as we are right at the 
          beginning of our journey here. It's better to use the time wisely and learn as much as possible, which may involve 
          leaving something not quite perfect, rather than getting bogged down and spending too much time on one aspect.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I have some experience with meditation and mindfulness prior to reading Chapter 2, though had previously found it difficult to constantly 
          pull my mind back from wandering. I was interested to read more about the tangible benefits it can have, as previously thought it
          was mostly for people who led stressful lives who needed some time to clear their mind. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm more inclined to give it a try moving forward, as taking 10 minutes to train my brain, especially if it will help 
          take control of my attention wandering, is a worthwhile effort.
