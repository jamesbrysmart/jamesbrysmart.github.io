    <h4>How to describe HTML, CSS and DOM?</h4>
    <p> HTML are the building blocks - it establishes the structure and foundations of the website. Using a house analogy, 
        HTML would decide how many rooms etc. CSS would be the designer, deciding on the layout of the kitchen, the colour of the walls etc. 
        The DOM is somewhat harder to explain with such a simple analogy - essentially it is what is making the HTML and CSS interact with each other
        to create the website. Maybe a project manager is a good analogy, making sure the designer and builders communicate to create the house.

    <h4>
        What is meant by boxifying design?
    </h4>
    <p>
        Boxifying design is a way of breaking down a complex design into easily manageable bits, so we can build from the bottom up rather than 
        looking at the whole web page and trying to work out where to start.
    </p>        
    <h4>
        What is the box model?
    </h4>
    <p>
        The box model helps us understand that every webpage is broken down into boxes, each with their own 'margin', 'border' and 'padding' (each of which is editable) which 
        will dictate how the element fits in alongside other boxes on the page.
