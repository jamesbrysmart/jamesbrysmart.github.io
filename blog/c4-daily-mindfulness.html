        <h2> Daily Mindfulness</h2>
        <p> 
          This is an interesting concept I've heard of before, when many people are mostly just waiting for their turn to speak, rather than actively listening.
          I found it easy as the listener, as did my flatmate. We hang out a lot so we have proper conversations like this, so it was pretty easy. The bigger challenge was
          speaking for a 3 minutes monologue, as I felt the need to talk about deep stuff, which actually caused me some mild anxiety. Probably not the point of the lesson but oh well.  
        </p>
           I like 'do less than you can' - I definitely resonate with the idea that the novelty starts to wear off pretty quickly and it becomes hard to maintain.
           That and one breath a day seem like a good way of getting over that hump.
