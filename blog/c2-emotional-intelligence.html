    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h2>Some thoughts  </h2>

    <p>
        Emotional intelligence is something I've read about before, but in different terms. Understanding the reasons behind our actions is fundamental to behavioural economics
        which I've read a fair bit about. I like to think this is an area I'm relatively strong at already, though still keen to see how I can improve. One area I'd potentially dispute is the link with happiness.
        Some people have good reasons to be sad, and introspection or an enhanced understanding of oneself won't remove that sadness. I definitely agree that a deeper understanding of ourselves and our emotions would lead to 
        more wholesome relationships and workplaces, especially for those who struggle with introspection.

        I've tried mindfulness before, though have previously found it difficult to stop my mind racing if I have a lot on my mind. This time I found it easier to control that aspect. 
        I personally don't seem to gain much enjoyment/satisfaction from it. I've seen up close that in extreme situations it doesn't always help, so is perhaps overrated as a cure - though if it works for you, great. 
        Especially if you are prone to stress and appreciate some time to just switch off without external stimuli.
